Motivation for the project:
Many children love to write stories and create original plots.

However, when they want to turn their stories into illustrated books, they encounter a limitationâ€”they need advanced illustration skills or must invest resources in hiring an illustrator.

As a result, many give up on visually illustrating their stories.

We aim to solve this problem by developing an application that allows children to create drawings automatically using AI for their stories based on the texts they write.
